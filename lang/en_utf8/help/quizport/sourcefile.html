<h1>Source file</h1>
<p>
    This setting specifies the file containing the content that will be
    shown to the students.
</p>
<p>
    Usually the source file will have been created outside of Moodle, and
    then uploaded to the files area of a Moodle course.
    It may be an html file, or it may be another kind of file that has been
    created with authoring software such as Hot Potatoes or Qedoc.
</p>
<p>
    The source file may be specified as a folder and file path in the Moodle
    course files area, or it may be a url beginning with http:// or https://
</p>
<p>
    For Qedoc materials, the source file must be the url of a Qedoc module
    that has been uploaded to the Qedoc server.
