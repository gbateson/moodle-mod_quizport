<h1>Sort order</h1>
<p>
    The sort-order of pre-conditions serves two purposes.
    Firstly, it specifies the order in which the pre-conditions are processed.
    Secondly, it allows pre-conditions to be combined into groups of conditions,
    any of which can enable access to the quiz.
</p>
<p>
    In the simple case, all pre-conditions have the same sort order, usually "0",
    and access to the quiz is granted if all the pre-conditions are satisfied.
</p>
<p>
    In a more complicated situation, pre-conditions on a quiz may have different sort-orders.
    In such a situation, pre-conditions will be grouped together acording to their sort order.
    There may be more than one pre-condition in any these groups.
    If all conditions in any group are satisfied then the student is given access to the quiz.
</p>
<p>
    In technical terms, we could say that the sort-order groups on a quiz are joined with logical-OR,
    whereas the members within a sort-order group are joined with logical-AND.
</p>
    To illustrate this with an example, consider the following conditions on a quiz
</p>
<ul>
    <li>sort-order group (1) contains pre-conditions (a), (b) and (c).</li>
    <li>sort-order group (2) contains pre-conditions (d) and (e)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The pre-conditions are satisfied if (a) AND (b) AND (c) are true, OR if (d) AND (e) are true.
</p>
