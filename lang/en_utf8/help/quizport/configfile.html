    If specified, the configuration file will be used when the browser content
    is generated from the source file.

    The exact function of the configuration file depends on the output format,
    but generally the settings in the configuration will override those in the
    source file.

    By using the same configuration file for several quizzes, the quizzes can
    be made to share the same messages, color scheme, layout or behaviors.

    For <b>Hot Potatoes</b> quizzes, the configuration file is a ".cfg" file.
    For <b>Qedoc</b> quizzes, this setting is not used.
