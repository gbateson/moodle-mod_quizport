<p>
    Void attempts occur when a student starts a QuizPort, but then does not
    attempt to answer an questions in any quizzes, before leaving. Such attempts
    can have a significant impact on the grade when the grading method is Average,
    First or Last. In such situations, the teacher may decide that it is better to
    ignore the void attempts when the grade is calculated.
