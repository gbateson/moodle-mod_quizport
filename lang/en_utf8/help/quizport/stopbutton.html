    If this setting is enabled, a stop button will be inserted into the quiz.

    If a student clicks the stop button, the results so far will be returned
    to Moodle and the status of the quiz attempt will be set to abandoned.

    The text that is displayed on the stop button can be one of the preset
    phrases from Moodle's language packs, or the teacher can specify their
