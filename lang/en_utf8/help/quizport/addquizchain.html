<h1>Add quiz chain</h1>

<div class="indent">
    <p>
        <b>No</b><br />
        Only one quiz will be added to the course
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Yes</b><br />
        If the source file is a <b>quiz file</b>, it is treated as the start of a chain
        of quizzes and all quizzes in the chain will be added to the course with
        identical settings. Each quiz in the chain must have a link to the next file
        in the chain.<br />
        <br />
        If the source file is a <b>folder</b>, all recognizable quizzes in the folder
        will be added to the course to form a chain of quizzes with identical settings.<br />
        <br />
        If the source file is a <b>unit file</b>, such as a Hot Potatoes masher file
        or index.html, quizzes listed in the unit file will be added to the course
        as a chain of quizzes with identical settings.
