<p>
    Void attempts occur when a student starts a quiz but then does not attempt
    to answer an questions before leaving the quiz. Such attempts can have a
    significant impact on the score when the scoring method is Average, First
    or Last. In such situations, the teacher may decide that it is better to
    ignore void attempts when the score is calculated.
