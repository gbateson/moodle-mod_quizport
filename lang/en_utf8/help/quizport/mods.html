<div class="indent">

    <p>The QuizPort module allows teachers to distribute interactive
    learning materials via Moodle and view details of the students' responses.
    The materials are created on the teacher's computer using authoring software such as
    <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/" target="_blank">Hot Potatoes</a> and
    <a href="http://www.qedoc.org/" target="_blank">Qedoc</a>, and then uploaded to the
    Moodle course.</p>

    <p>After students have attempted the quizzes, a number of reports are available which
    show how individual questions were answered and some statistical trends in the scores.</p>
